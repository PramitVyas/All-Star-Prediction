# All-Star-Prediction
# NBA All-Star Prediction Model

## Overview

This project aims to predict NBA All-Star selections using statistical models. The model is trained on player statistics and team information to predict the likelihood of a player being selected as an NBA All-Star.

## Features

The model considers various features for prediction, including:

- Player performance metrics (e.g., VORP, FT, PTS, FG, USG%, AST, TRB, MP, GS, BLK, NRtg, etc.)
- Team information (Winning percentage, Team code)

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training the model.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model development.
- `models/`: Saved model files.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nba-allstar-prediction.git
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the model:
bash
Copy code
python scripts/train_model.py
Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory for in-depth analysis.
Results
The model achieves an accuracy of [insert accuracy here] on the test set.

Usage
To use the model for predicting All-Star selections for a new season, you can follow these steps:

Prepare a dataset with player statistics and team information for the new season.
Use the trained model to predict All-Star selections.
python
Copy code
# Example usage in Python
import pandas as pd
from your_module import predict_all_stars

# Load new season data
new_season_data = pd.read_csv("path/to/new_season_data.csv")

# Predict All-Stars
all_star_predictions = predict_all_stars(new_season_data)
print(all_star_predictions)
